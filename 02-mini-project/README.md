# DM2008 - Mini Project: BONG (BASTARD PONG)

## Foreword from Ty
I saw God multiple times coding this. He looked down on me and laughed to my face

## What Ty learned
1. THE IMPORTANCE OF PSEUDOCODE
Code is overwhelming. Jumping into it made me stumble over my feet with thinking about all the features I wanted to implement and all the organisation that needed to happen. I found myself leaning on the pseudocode I wrote before I started coding. "Single player mode where the player uses mouse to control both paddles" became boolean variables that defined whether single player or multiplayer mode was activated, and what triggers made those booleans true.  "When players lose 10 times, they unlock free movement because why not!", which then translated into "I need to change the .vx". 

I found myself falling back onto my logic the most, which made coding so satisfying. Because when the code worked the way I wanted to, it felt like my brain understood the language that p5js was speaking to me. TLDR; if all else fails, dumb it down for human brain.

2. WRITING CODE IN THE RIGHT CODE BLOCKS

3. I LOVE 'IF ELSE' STATEMENTS...'FOR' STATEMENTS THO...
